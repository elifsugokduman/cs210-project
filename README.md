Spotify Data Analysis
Description
This project is designed to analyze Spotify data using Python. It utilizes the spotipy library to access Spotify's Web API and pandas for data manipulation and analysis. The main focus is on applying machine learning techniques to understand and predict various aspects of music tracks.

Key features:

Clustering of songs based on their audio features to identify similar tracks.
Predicting the popularity of songs using linear regression based on their audio features.
Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running:
pip install spotipy pandas sklearn
Usage
The project consists of two main parts:

Clustering: This section groups songs into clusters based on their audio features using K-means clustering.

Linear Regression: This part of the code predicts the popularity of songs based on their audio features using a linear regression model.
